# ANALYZING COMMODITY GROUP INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND LENDING RATES WITH THE NEO-FISHER EFFECT
This is our thesis work (Bri√±a, Galapate, Manlapig, & Rosero, 2024).

## What is Neo-Fisher Effect?
Neo-Fisher is an economic theory that states that interest rate causes the inflation expectation. This means that economic agents consider interest rate in price level expectations.

## Summary
The study investigates the causal relationship from lending rates to commodity
inflation expectations and forecasts the inflation expectation for two years in the
Philippines, incorporating the Neo-Fisher effect. This study employed monthly data from
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas starting from September 1997 up to October 2023. The results
of Granger Causality tests revealed the presence of the Neo-Fisher Effect. High lending
rate granger causes inflation expectations for all items, including clothing and footwear,
health, transport, information and communication, recreation, sport and culture, personal
care, and miscellaneous goods and services. Conversely, low lending rate granger causes
all the variables that high lending rates granger cause, along with inflation expectation for
food and non-alcoholic beverages, and education services. This study recommends,
among others, that monetary authorities should consider commodity inflation expectation
granger caused by lending rates in inflation targeting. Additionally, given that the
forecasting model using linear regression with first-order autoregressive term did not
satisfy regression assumptions, the researchers recommend that future researchers
should integrate GDP growth, natural disasters, exchange rate, political stability,
international oil prices, and government policies to account for residual outliers.

## Research Questions

### 1. What is the behavior of the following variables from 1997 to 2023?
**A. Commodity inflation expectations**
- All commodity inflation expectations have been volatile for the past 26 years,
    except for information and communication, which has remained stable for the
    past 17 years.
- Inflation expectations in 2016 were much lower than those in 2020. This could be
    attributed to stable food prices, lower global oil prices, and sound monetary
    policies by the BSP in 2016.
- Similar to lending rates, inflation expectations for clothing and footwear,
    furnishing, household equipment and routine household maintenance, health,
    information and communication, education services, and personal care and
    miscellaneous goods and services also peaked during the late 1990s.
- Inflation expectations for recreation, sport, and culture, as well as alcoholic
    beverages and tobacco, experienced a massive increase during mid-2012 to
    2015. Conversely, inflation expectations for restaurants and accommodation
    services reached their lowest value during the same period.
- Inflation expectation for food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing, water,
    electricity, gas, and other fuels, transport, information and communication,
    recreation, sport, and culture, education services, and all items have been
    expected to decrease, considering the minimum values were negative.
- The average inflation expectation for the past 26 years, which is 4.37, exceeded
    the target inflation rate of the BSP.
    
**B. Lending rates**
- Over the past 26 years, lending rates have exhibited peaks occurring in the late
    1990s primarily due to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. This crisis triggered
    capital outflows and currency depreciation, particularly for the Philippine peso,
    which depreciated by an average of 26% against the US Dollar.
- There is a noticeable widening gap between the high and low lending rates.
- Despite the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, lending
    rates experienced a slight decline in 2020 and continuous recovery thereafter.
    This could be attributed to the notably Circular No. 1098, which BSP imposed
    ceilings on interest or finance charges from credit card transactions.
- The average high lending rate stands at 10.44, while the average low lending rate
    is 7.84.


### 2. Does high lending rate granger cause commodity inflation expectation?
The results have shown that high lending rate granger cause inflation expectation
for all items, clothing and footwear, health, transport, information and
communication, recreation, sport and culture, and personal care, and
miscellaneous goods and services. Due to this finding, the null hypothesis that
posits that high lending rate does not granger cause commodity inflation
expectation was rejected.

### 3. Does high lending rate significantly forecast commodity inflation expectations?
None of the forecasting models, specifically inflation expectation for all items,
clothing and footwear, health, transport, information and communication,
recreation, sport and culture, and personal care, and miscellaneous goods and
services, met the assumptions of no serial autocorrelation, normal distribution, and
constant variance of residuals. Consequently, interpretations of inflation
expectation forecasts and summary statistics were not possible. As a result, the
hypothesis regarding the forecast of commodity inflation expectations based on
high lending rates cannot be definitively accepted or rejected, therefore
inconclusive. This finding prompted the researchers to explore the residuals
outliers, leading to the recommendation that future studies should incorporate
variables such as GDP growth to account for the economic downturns and demand
driven inflation, exchange rates to include the cost of imports, natural disasters to
take into account the typhoon and climate patterns that sustain damage to
agriculture, tourism, and other industry, political stability for considering disruption
of political conflict not only to economic activities but also the public expectation on the economy, the government policy such as wage increase, and international oil prices to account for increase cost in transportation and production.

### 4. Does low lending rate granger cause commodity inflation expectation?
The study findings suggested that low lending rate granger caused inflation
expectation for all items, food and non-alcoholic beverages, clothing and footwear,
health, transport, information and communication, recreation, sport and culture,
education services, and personal care, and miscellaneous goods and services.
Consequently, the null hypothesis that stated that the low lending rate does not
granger cause commodity inflation expectations was rejected.

### 5. Does low lending rate significantly forecast commodity inflation expectations?
Forecasting inflation expectations with low lending rate was essentially the same
as utilizing high lending rate, except for the additional variables of FOOD and EDUC
as forecasted variables, and additional outlier periods such as 2007, 2008, 2017,
and 2018 in the residuals. Each forecasting model for inflation expectation of all
items, food and non-alcoholic beverages, clothing and footwear, health, transport,
information and communication, recreation, sport and culture, education services,
personal care, and miscellaneous goods and services did not meet the
assumptions of constant variance, normality, and absence of serial autocorrelation
in residuals. Upon investigating the residual outliers, researchers discovered that
the 2008 FIELDS program, the 2018 excise tax hike, and the 2000 international oil
price increase show the impact of government policies and international oil prices
on inflation. Additionally, residual outliers show that whether the high or low lending
rate is utilized, variables such as GDP growth, exchange rate, natural disasters,
political stability, international oil prices, and government policies should be
considered in the forecasting model.

### 6. Do statistically significant high and low lending rates granger cause the same commodity inflation expectations?
Although both high and low lending rates granger caused inflation expectation for
all items, clothing and footwear, health, transport, information and communication,
recreation, sport and culture, and personal care, and miscellaneous goods and
services, low lending rate granger cause variables exclusively, only low lending
rate granger causes inflation expectation for food and non-alcoholic beverages and
education services. Considering this finding, the researchers accepted the null
hypothesis that statistically significant high and low lending rates do not granger
cause the same commodity inflation expectations. Furthermore, studies by Mirza &
Rashidi (2018), Phiri (2020), Uribe (2022), Epor and Yua (2024) have also validated
the Neo-Fisher Effect theory.
