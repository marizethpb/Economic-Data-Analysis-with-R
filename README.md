# ANALYZING COMMODITY GROUP INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND LENDING RATES WITH THE NEO-FISHER EFFECT
This is our thesis work (Bri√±a, Galapate, Manlapig, & Rosero, 2024).

## What is Neo-Fisher Effect?
Neo-Fisher is an economic theory that states that interest rate causes the inflation expectation. 

## Research Questions
1. What is the behavior of the following variables from 1997 to 2023?
A. Commodity inflation expectations
B. Lending rates
2. Does high lending rate granger cause commodity inflation expectations?
3. Does high lending rate significantly forecast commodity inflation
expectations?
4. Does low lending rate granger cause commodity inflation expectations?
5. Does low lending rate significantly forecast commodity inflation
expectations?
6. Do statistically significant high and low lending rates granger cause the
same commodity inflation expectations?

## Summary
The study investigates the causal relationship from lending rates to commodity
inflation expectations and forecasts the inflation expectation for two years in the
Philippines, incorporating the Neo-Fisher effect. This study employed monthly data from
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas starting from September 1997 up to October 2023. The results
of Granger Causality tests revealed the presence of the Neo-Fisher Effect. High lending
rate granger causes inflation expectations for all items, including clothing and footwear,
health, transport, information and communication, recreation, sport and culture, personal
care, and miscellaneous goods and services. Conversely, low lending rate granger causes
all the variables that high lending rates granger cause, along with inflation expectation for
food and non-alcoholic beverages, and education services. This study recommends,
among others, that monetary authorities should consider commodity inflation expectation
granger caused by lending rates in inflation targeting. Additionally, given that the
forecasting model using linear regression with first-order autoregressive term did not
satisfy regression assumptions, the researchers recommend that future researchers
should integrate GDP growth, natural disasters, exchange rate, political stability,
international oil prices, and government policies to account for residual outliers.
