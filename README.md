# ANALYZING COMMODITY GROUP INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND LENDING RATES WITH THE NEO-FISHER EFFECT
This is our thesis work (Bri√±a, Galapate, Manlapig, & Rosero, 2024).

## What is Neo-Fisher Effect
Neo-Fisher is an economic theory that states that interest rate causes the inflation expectation. 

## Objective
Our study aims to determine the specific lending interest rate and that granger cause specific commodity inflation expectation as Neo-Fisher Effect is rather general. This study has 2 dependent variables which are low and high lending rate, and 13 commodity groups which are shown below. The researchers performed 26 granger causality analysis to determine validity of the theory. Additionally, forecasting models with first autoregression term were performed to mimic the granger causality model and determine the forecasting ability of interest rate on specific commodity inflation expectations.
